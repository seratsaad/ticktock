For FUVA, the C1055A and C1096A          HISTORY spectra of AzV75 (13070) were compared to the COS C1222 FUVB            HISTORY processed spectrum. This comparison was performed for the full          HISTORY overlap region in wavelength space between C1222B and C1096/55A.        HISTORY The dispersion solution was updated in both zero_point and              HISTORY dispersion as determined by the correlations in the IDL program         HISTORY written by SVP in the repository as measure_lp2offset_bm.pro. This      HISTORY process was repeated until the dispersion solution converged onto       HISTORY the best solution. The history of these updates is captured in the      HISTORY IDL .pro file used to recreate the updating reference files (in         HISTORY the repository as convert_bm_lp1_to_lp2_disp.pro). Data processed       HISTORY with this solution was then compared by Paule Sonnentrucker to a        HISTORY model spectrum of AzV75. This comparison used careful                   HISTORY cross-correlations of the ISM lines only. This comparison was used      HISTORY to adjust the zero-point offset to its final solution.
